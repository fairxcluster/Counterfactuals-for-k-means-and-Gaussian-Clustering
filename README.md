Soft Fair Clustering Framework

This repository provides a research framework for soft fair clustering in tabular data. It implements a full pipeline that balances protected subgroups, applies Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with fairlet decompositions, aligns clusters across fair and unfair models, and quantifies fairness through misalignment, NMI costs, and counterfactual distances.
